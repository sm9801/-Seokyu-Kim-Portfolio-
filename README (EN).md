# Seokyu Kim - Data Scientist Portfolio

## Brief Introduction
Hello, my name is Seokyu Kim and I am a Data Scientist currently working in the skincare and beauty industry.
<br>
At the University of British Columbia, I graduated with a B.S. in mathematics and studied subjects such as probability and linear algebra, where I first encountered data.
<br>
It was here where I became interested in AI and machine learning. Realizing the need to develop my skills in statistical analysis and modeling, I registered for professional education at MITx.
<br>
Here, I participated in research projects such as analyzing U.S. inflation rates, testing suitability of PCA / t-SNE algorithms for neuron segmentations, and predicting CO<sub>2</sub> levels at the Mauna Loa volcano.
<br>
Currently, I am developing an AI Chatbot for KPI Analysis and Decision/Operations Support at a skincare company.
<br>
Always eager to learn and with consistent growth, I aim to become a 'Robust Data Scientist'.
